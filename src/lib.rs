//! # yawc
//! Implementation of the WebSocket protocol (RFC 6455) and permessage-deflate compression (RFC 7692),
//! offering automatic handling for control frames, message fragmentation, and negotiated compression.
//!
//! The WebSocket implementation is fully compliant with the Autobahn test suite for both server and client configurations.
//!
//! The library supports WebAssembly (WASM) targets, allowing WebSocket connections in browser environments, with a few caveats:
//! frame manipulation is not possible since browsers don't allow sending raw frames (though the FrameView struct is still used),
//! and only text mode (UTF-8 strings) is currently supported. Pull requests are welcome to add binary support.
//!
//! # Features
//! The crate provides several optional features that can be enabled in your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! - `reqwest`: Enables WebSocket support using reqwest as the HTTP client. Recommended for client-side
//!   applications that need a higher-level HTTP client interface.
//!
//! - `axum`: Enables WebSocket support for the axum web framework through an extractor. Allows handling
//!   WebSocket connections in axum route handlers.
//!
//! - `zlib`: Enables advanced compression options using zlib, including window size control. This allows
//!   fine-tuning of the compression level and memory usage through `client_max_window_bits` and
//!   `server_max_window_bits` options.
//!
//! - `logging`: Enables debug logging for connection negotiation and frame processing using the `log` crate.
//!   Useful for debugging WebSocket connections.
//!
//! - `json`: Enables serialization of JSON data. Useful for handling JSON payloads in WebSocket messages.
//!
//! ## Usage Example
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! yawc = { version = "0.1", features = ["axum"] }
//! ```
//!
//! # Compression Support
//! The crate implements the permessage-deflate WebSocket extension (RFC 7692) with configurable options:
//!
//! - Context takeover control for both client and server
//! - Compression level adjustment (0-9)
//! - Window size configuration (with `zlib` feature)
//! - Memory usage optimization through no-context-takeover options
//!
//! # Client Example
//! ```rust
//! use tokio::net::TcpStream;
//! use futures::{SinkExt, StreamExt};
//! use yawc::{WebSocket, frame::OpCode};
//!
//! async fn client_connect(client: reqwest::Client) -> yawc::Result<()> {
//!     let mut ws = WebSocket::connect("wss://echo.websocket.org".parse()?).await?;
//!
//!     while let Some(frame) = ws.next().await {
//!         match frame.opcode {
//!             OpCode::Text | OpCode::Binary => {
//!                 ws.send(frame).await?;
//!             }
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Server Example
//! ```rust
//! use http_body_util::Empty;
//! use futures::StreamExt;
//! use hyper::{Request, body::{Incoming, Bytes}, Response};
//! use yawc::{WebSocket};
//!
//! async fn server_upgrade(
//!     mut req: Request<Incoming>,
//! ) -> yawc::Result<Response<Empty<Bytes>>> {
//!     let (response, fut) = WebSocket::upgrade(&mut req)?;
//!
//!     tokio::spawn(async move {
//!         if let Ok(mut ws) = fut.await {
//!             while let Some(frame) = ws.next().await {
//!               // Process frames from the client here
//!             }
//!         }
//!     });
//!
//!     Ok(response)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Memory Safety
//! The crate implements several safety measures:
//! - Maximum payload size limits (configurable, default 2MB)
//! - Automatic handling of control frames
//! - Optional UTF-8 validation for text frames
//! - Protection against memory exhaustion attacks
//!
//! # Performance Considerations
//! - Compression can be tuned for either memory usage or compression ratio
//! - Context takeover settings allow memory-CPU tradeoffs
//! - Zero-copy frame processing where possible
//! - Efficient handling of fragmented messages
