- **Autobahn Test Suite**: Passes all test cases for both client and server modes
- **WebAssembly Support**: Works seamlessly in WASM environments for browser-based applications

## Which crate should I use?

When choosing a WebSocket implementation, many developers default to [tokio-tungstenite](https://github.com/snapview/tokio-tungstenite).
As the most stable and widely-used crate in the ecosystem, it provides excellent abstraction over the
WebSocket protocol through its [WebSocketStream](https://docs.rs/tokio-tungstenite/latest/tokio_tungstenite/struct.WebSocketStream.html) type,
which allows projects to implement custom protocols via its generic `<S>` parameter.

While yawc doesn't expose the underlying stream directly,
it provides access to `poll` methods via [futures::Stream](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/prelude/trait.Stream.html)
and [futures::Sink](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/prelude/trait.Sink.html) implementations.
Key features include built-in compression support, zero-copy operations where possible, and first-class WebAssembly support for UI development.
Beyond passing comprehensive test suites including Autobahn,
yawc has proven its reliability in production environments powering 24/7 market trading systems.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
yawc = "0.2"
```

### Client Example

```rust
use futures::SinkExt;
use futures::StreamExt;
use yawc::{frame::FrameView, frame::OpCode, Options, Result, WebSocket};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Connect with default options
    let mut ws = WebSocket::connect("wss://echo.websocket.org".parse()?).await?;

    // Send and receive messages
    ws.send(FrameView::text("Hello WebSocket!")).await?;

    while let Some(frame) = ws.next().await {
        match frame.opcode {
            OpCode::Text => println!("Received: {}", std::str::from_utf8(&frame.payload).unwrap()),
            OpCode::Binary => println!("Received binary: {} bytes", frame.payload.len()),
            _ => {} // Handle control frames automatically
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

```toml
[dependencies]
yawc = { version = "0.2" }
futures = { version = "0.3", default-features = false, features = ["std"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["rt", "rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }
```

### Server Example

```rust
use hyper::{Request, Response, body::Incoming};
use futures::StreamExt;
use futures::SinkExt;
use bytes::Bytes;
use http_body_util::Empty;
use yawc::{WebSocket, Result};

async fn handle_upgrade(req: Request<Incoming>) -> Result<Response<Empty<Bytes>>> {
    // Upgrade the connection
    let (response, upfn) = WebSocket::upgrade(req)?;

    // Handle the WebSocket connection in a separate task
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        let mut ws = upfn.await.expect("upgrade");

        while let Some(frame) = ws.next().await {
            // Echo the received frames back to the client
            let _ = ws.send(frame).await;
        }
    });

    Ok(response)
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // configure the server
}
```

```toml
[dependencies]
yawc = {version = "0.2", features = ["reqwest"] }
futures = { version = "0.3.31", default-features = false, features = ["std"] }
tokio = { version = "1.41.1", features = ["rt", "rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }
hyper = { version = "1.5.0", features = ["http1", "server"] }
http-body-util = "0.1.2"
bytes = "1.8.0"
```

The [`examples`](https://github.com/infinitefield/yawc/tree/master/examples) directory contains several documented and runnable examples showcasing advanced WebSocket functionality.
You can find a particularly comprehensive example in the [`axum_proxy`](https://github.com/infinitefield/yawc/tree/master/examples/axum_proxy) implementation, which demonstrates:

- Building a WebSocket broadcast server that efficiently relays messages between multiple connected clients
- Creating a reverse proxy that transparently forwards WebSocket connections to upstream servers
- Proper connection lifecycle management and error handling Integration with the Axum web framework for robust HTTP request handling
- Advanced usage patterns like connection pooling and message filtering

These examples serve as practical reference implementations for common WebSocket architectural patterns and best practices using yawc.

## Feature Flags

- `reqwest`: Use reqwest as the HTTP client
- `axum`: Enable integration with the Axum web framework
- `logging`: Enable debug logging for connection events
- `zlib`: Enable advanced compression options with zlib (not recommended unless you know what you are doing)
- `rustls-ring`: Enable the fallback rustls crypto provider based on `ring`
- `rustls-aws-lc-rs`: Enable the fallback rustls crypto provider based on `aws-lc-rs`

### Axum Server Example

```rust
use axum::{
    routing::get,
    Router,
};
use yawc::{IncomingUpgrade, Options};

async fn websocket_handler(ws: IncomingUpgrade) -> axum::response::Response {
    let options = Options::default()
        .with_compression_level(CompressionLevel::default())
        .with_utf8();

    let (response, ws) = ws.upgrade(options).unwrap();

    // Handle the WebSocket connection in a separate task
    tokio::spawn(async move {
        if let Ok(mut ws) = ws.await {
            while let Ok(frame) = ws.next_frame().await {
                // Echo the received frames back to the client
                let _ = ws.send(frame).await;
            }
        }
    });

    response
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let app = Router::new()
        .route("/ws", get(websocket_handler));

    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:3000").await.unwrap();
    axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}
```

To use the Axum integration, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
yawc = { version = "0.2", features = ["axum"] }
axum = "0.7"
```

## Advanced Features

### Compression Control

Fine-tune compression settings for optimal performance:

```rust
use yawc::{Options, DeflateOptions, CompressionLevel};

let options = Options::default()
    .with_compression_level(CompressionLevel::default())
    .server_no_context_takeover()  // Optimize memory usage
    .with_client_max_window_bits(11);  // Control compression window (requires zlib feature)
```

### Split Streams

Split the WebSocket for independent reading and writing:

```rust
let (mut write, mut read) = ws.split();

// Read and write concurrently
tokio::join!(
    async move { while let Some(frame) = read.next().await { /* ... */ } },
    async move { write.send(FrameView::text("Hello")).await? }
);
```

### Custom Frame Handling

Process frames manually when needed:

```rust
match frame.opcode {
    OpCode::Ping => {
        // Automatic pong responses
        println!("Received ping");
    }
    OpCode::Close => {
        // Handle close frames
        let code = u16::from_be_bytes(frame.payload[0..2].try_into()?);
        println!("Connection closing with code: {}", code);
    }
    _ => { /* Handle data frames */ }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Uses zero-copy frame processing where possible
- Efficient handling of fragmented messages
- Configurable compression levels for bandwidth/CPU tradeoffs
- Memory-efficient compression contexts

## Safety and Security

- Maximum payload size limits (configurable, default 2MB)
- Automatic masking of client frames
- Optional UTF-8 validation for text frames
- Protection against memory exhaustion attacks
- TLS support for secure connections

## Motivation

While several WebSocket libraries exist for Rust's async ecosystem,
none of them provide the full combination of features needed for high-performance,
production-ready applications while maintaining a simple API.
Existing libraries lack proper full-duplex stream support, zero-copy operations,
or compression capabilities - or implement these features with complex, difficult-to-use APIs.
Additionally, most libraries require significant codebase changes to support WebAssembly,
whereas yawc maintains compatibility across platforms without forcing developers to rewrite their code.
This library aims to provide all these critical features with an ergonomic interface
that makes WebSocket development straightforward and efficient across native and WASM environments.
